<h1>Manual Testing Project for COFEEHOUSE</h1>

```
User Story:

As a user, I want to access the coffeehouse application, view the menu, and place a coffee order.

Requirements:

  When the user accesses the Coffeehouse website, they should be redirected to the main page of the application.
  The main page consists of three elements:
Header: Contains the company emblem and four buttons: Home, Menu, Offers, and Contacts.
Body: Displays an offer and includes a “Buy Now!” button.
Footer: Contains icons for the following social networks: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Instagram.

  If we click on the company logo in the header, we will be redirected to the main page.
  If we click on the following links:
Home: Redirects to the main page: (https://cofeehouse.web.app).
Menu: Redirects to the menu page: (https://cofeehouse.web.app/menu).
Offers: Redirects to the offers page: (https://cofeehouse.web.app/offers).
Contact: Redirects to the contact page: (https://cofeehouse.web.app/contacts).

  Menu Page:
Displays all available coffee assortments as cards, each containing an image of the product and its name. Cards cannot be edited.

  Offers Page:
Shows the latest company offers as cards, each with a promotional image of the product and its name. Clicking on a card redirects the user to the offer page.
